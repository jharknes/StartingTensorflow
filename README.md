StartingTensorflow

These are my first python scripts using Tensorflow. These scripts are taken from the book Fundamentals of Deep Learning by Nikhil Buduma
and have been editted for note taking by myself. Some minor differences in code may exist outside of comments as some of the code provided
in the text does not work properly or involves outside libraries the author did not include.

The pupose of this repository is for my own notes.
